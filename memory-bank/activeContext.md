# Active Context: Job Tracker Application

## 1. Current Work Focus

*   **Initial Project Review and Documentation:** The primary focus is on understanding the existing Job Tracker Application, its features, technology stack, and architecture.
*   **Memory Bank Initialization:** Creating the core Memory Bank documents (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) to establish a baseline understanding for future development and assistance.
*   **Report Generation:** Preparing a report for the user summarizing the project's current state based on the initial review and the newly created Memory Bank.

## 2. Recent Changes / Activities

*   **Read `README.md`:** To get an overview of the project.
*   **Analyzed Project Structure:** Based on the file list provided in `environment_details`.
*   **Reviewed Configuration Files:**
    *   `package.json` (dependencies, scripts)
    *   `next.config.mjs` (Next.js specific settings)
    *   `tailwind.config.ts` (Tailwind CSS setup)
    *   `tsconfig.json` (TypeScript settings)
*   **Created Core Memory Bank Files:**
    *   `projectbrief.md`
    *   `productContext.md`
    *   `techContext.md`
    *   `systemPatterns.md`

## 3. Next Steps (for current task)

1.  **Create `progress.md`:** To document the current status of the application's features and known issues (based on available information).
2.  **Synthesize Information:** Consolidate findings from the Memory Bank files.
3.  **Generate Project Report:** Present a summary of the project's features, technology, architecture, and current status to the user.
4.  **Await User Feedback:** Understand if further clarification or specific areas of focus are needed for the report or subsequent tasks.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

*   **Memory Bank First:** Adhering to the "Cline's Memory Bank" protocol by prioritizing the creation of these foundational documents before proceeding with a detailed report. This ensures a structured understanding.
*   **Information Sources:** Relying on `README.md`, project file structure, and key configuration files for the initial assessment. Direct code review of component logic will be a subsequent step if deeper analysis is required.
*   **Scope of Report:** The initial report will be a high-level overview based on the documented features and inferred architecture. It will not include a deep dive into the implementation details of every component unless specifically requested or deemed necessary for understanding.

This document reflects the context as of the initial project review. It will be updated as new tasks are undertaken or the project focus shifts.
