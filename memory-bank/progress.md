# Progress: Job Tracker Application

## 1. What Works (Features Listed in README.md)

Based on the `README.md`, the following features are implemented and considered functional:

*   **Core Job Tracking:**
    *   Kanban board for job application visualization.
    *   Adding, editing, deleting, and moving job cards.
    *   Storing job details (title, company, URL, etc.).
    *   Drag-and-drop interface for job cards and columns.
*   **Advanced Features:**
    *   Web mining system to extract job details from URLs (via `app/api/job-scraper/`).
    *   Keyword suggestions with color-coded categories (technical, soft skills, requirements).
*   **Data Management:**
    *   Export job data to JSON and CSV.
    *   Import job data from JSON and CSV.
    *   Data persistence via browser Local Storage.
*   **Customization:**
    *   Customizable job states (columns) with names and color options.
    *   Reordering columns.
*   **Document Management (Sections Exist):**
    *   Resume management pages (`app/resume/`).
    *   Cover letter pages (`app/cover-letter/`).
    *   (The extent of functionality within these sections is not detailed in `README.md` beyond their existence).
*   **Analytics (Section Exists):**
    *   Job application statistics and analytics pages (`app/statistics/`).
    *   (Specific metrics or types of analytics are not detailed in `README.md`).
*   **User Interface & Experience:**
    *   Dark theme support (via `next-themes`).
    *   Fully responsive design.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):**
    *   Support for English and Spanish is evident from `app/i18n/translations/` and `lib/i18n/`.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Potential Enhancements

This section is based on common expectations for such an application or areas not explicitly detailed as complete in the `README.md`.

*   **Detailed Document Management:**
    *   Functionality for uploading, versioning, or linking multiple resume/cover letter files.
    *   Associating specific resume/cover letter versions with specific job applications.
*   **Advanced Analytics:**
    *   More detailed and configurable charts/reports within the statistics section.
    *   Tracking metrics like application success rates by source, time-to-hire, etc.
*   **Job Scraper Robustness:**
    *   The effectiveness and reliability of the web scraper across various job board websites can always be an area for improvement and maintenance.
    *   User feedback mechanisms for failed scraping attempts.
*   **User Authentication & Cloud Sync (Beyond Initial Scope):**
    *   The `README.md` states local storage is used. True cloud synchronization and user accounts would be a significant future enhancement if desired.
    *   The `app/login/` page exists, but its current functionality (if any beyond a placeholder) isn't detailed. It might be for a very basic local profile or a stub for future auth.
*   **Notifications/Reminders:**
    *   Setting reminders for follow-ups or application deadlines.
*   **Advanced Search and Filtering:**
    *   More granular search capabilities within the job list beyond basic filtering.
*   **Error Handling and User Feedback:**
    *   While `sonner` is used for toasts, comprehensive error handling across all user interactions and API calls is an ongoing concern.
    *   The `next.config.mjs` settings `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds: true` and `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors: true` imply that there might be known linting/type issues that are currently bypassed in the build process. These should ideally be addressed.

## 3. Current Status

*   **Functionally Rich Client-Side Application:** The application appears to have a solid set of core features for job tracking, primarily operating on the client-side.
*   **Ready for Use (Local Data):** Users can install and run the application locally to manage their job search.
*   **Dependencies:** The project uses up-to-date major versions of key dependencies like Next.js (v15) and React (v19).
*   **Setup:** Setup scripts (`setup.sh`, `setup.bat`) are provided, which is good for ease of installation.

## 4. Known Issues / Areas for Attention

*   **Build Process Warnings:** The configuration to ignore ESLint and TypeScript errors during builds (`eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds: true`, `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors: true` in `next.config.mjs`) is a potential concern. While this can speed up development or CI, it may hide underlying code quality or type safety issues that could lead to runtime errors. These should be investigated and resolved.
*   **Unoptimized Images:** `images.unoptimized: true` in `next.config.mjs`. While this might be intentional (e.g., for simplicity if all images are SVGs or very small), it means Next.js's powerful image optimization features are not being used. If raster images (PNG, JPG) are used extensively, this could impact performance.
*   **Local Storage Limitations:**
    *   Data is not automatically backed up or synced across devices. Users must rely on manual export/import.
    *   Local Storage has size limits, which could become an issue for users with a very large number of job applications and extensive notes over time.
*   **Job Scraper Maintenance:** Web scrapers are inherently fragile and can break when website structures change. The `job-scraper` API will likely require ongoing maintenance.
*   **Completeness of Non-Core Sections:** The `README.md` mentions sections like Resume, Cover Letter, and Statistics, but the depth of functionality within these is not fully detailed. They might be placeholders or have basic implementations.

This progress overview is based on the initial review of project documentation and configuration. A deeper code review would be necessary to confirm the exact status of each feature and identify further areas for improvement.
