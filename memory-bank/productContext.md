# Product Context: Job Tracker Application

## 1. Problem Statement

The modern job search process can be overwhelming and disorganized. Job seekers often juggle numerous applications across various platforms, leading to:

*   **Difficulty tracking application statuses:** Remembering which jobs have been applied to, interviewed for, or rejected.
*   **Scattered information:** Job descriptions, contact details, notes, and deadlines are often spread across different documents, emails, or browser tabs.
*   **Inefficient management of application materials:** Keeping track of different versions of resumes and cover letters tailored for specific roles.
*   **Missed opportunities:** Forgetting to follow up or losing track of promising leads.
*   **Lack of insight into job search effectiveness:** Difficulty analyzing which strategies are working or identifying patterns in job requirements.

## 2. Solution: Job Tracker Application

The Job Tracker Application aims to solve these problems by providing a centralized, intuitive, and powerful tool to manage all aspects of the job search.

**Value Proposition:**
*   **Organization:** Consolidates all job application information in one place.
*   **Efficiency:** Streamlines common tasks like saving job details (via web mining) and tracking progress.
*   **Insight:** Offers features like keyword suggestions and (eventually) analytics to help users understand job requirements and their application patterns.
*   **Control:** Empowers users with customizable views (Kanban board, job states) and data management (export/import).
*   **Privacy:** Keeps user data private by storing it in the browser's local storage.

    *   Offers accessibility features like a dark theme.
*   **Reliable:**
    *   Ensures data integrity and provides mechanisms for data backup (export).

## 4. Target User Profile & Key Scenarios

*   **Profile:** Active job seekers who apply to multiple positions and want a structured way to manage their search. This includes students, recent graduates, and experienced professionals.
*   **Key Scenarios:**
    *   **Adding a New Job:** User finds a job online, quickly adds it to the tracker, either manually or by pasting a URL for web mining.
    *   **Tracking Progress:** User moves job cards across a Kanban board (e.g., "Applied," "Interviewing," "Offer") as their applications progress.
    *   **Reviewing Applications:** User easily views all details for a specific job, including notes and attached documents.
    *   **Preparing for an Interview:** User reviews job description keywords and their resume/cover letter for that application.
    *   **Managing Job States:** User customizes the columns on their Kanban board to match their personal job search stages.
    *   **Backing Up Data:** User exports their job list to a JSON or CSV file for safekeeping.
